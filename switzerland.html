            <h3>Switzerland</h3>
            <p>
              Switzerland is a breathtakingly beautiful land-locked country in Central Europe with France to the west, Italy to the south, Austria to the east and Germany to the north. The country is famous for its scenic Alps and its rolling hills, plains, and lakes. It is also renowned for its chocolates and watches, while the Swiss knife is a legend in itself! Tourism in Switzerland is a delight of skiing, snow-walking, gorging on chocolates and cheeses and of course, swaying in the Alps. Here is a travel guide to Switzerland for one and sundry, to help you plan your next holiday.
